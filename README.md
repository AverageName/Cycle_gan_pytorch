# CycleGAN (Unofficial PyTorch Implementation)
Implementation of CycleGAN from this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593 <br/>
Starting as a JupyterNotebook prototype, later will be or Web App or Mobile App only using one or two generators from each model.<br/>
# Steps to do: <br/>
- :heavy_check_mark: Code down first prototype (Doesn't have to make some fair translation).
- :x: Develop more detailed plan of work.
- :x: Debug and make prototype output some fair Image-to-Image translation.
- :x: Decide which 2 domains to choose.
- :x: Decide Web or Mobile App.
- :x: Choose Android, IOS or cross-platform if Mobile and how to host if Web.
- :x: Read and think about fused batch normalization, quantization.
- :x: Get it all together.
